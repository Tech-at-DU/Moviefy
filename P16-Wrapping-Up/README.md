Final stretch!

As of now, if you try running the code above, you'll get an error saying the url can't be opened.

```Swift
redirect_to=moviefy: //auth
```

Right now you are saying to safari, that the phone should open the app moviefy.

This happens from an external source and your app needs a way of knowing when an external party wants to open it.

You need to set up a URL Scheme.

This should get you a working session now.

Make sure you get the message on the console:

```Swift
Request token YOUR_TOKEN was approved
```

# Getting the Username

Now it's your turn to find the way of getting the username and displaying it in the `LoginViewController`.


**Hint** check out the documentation [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/account/get-account-details) to get started.

# Stretches

> Give the user the option to logout ðŸ˜‰ (this should clear the username).



# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'create URLScheme'
$ git push
```
