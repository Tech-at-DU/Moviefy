## Stretch Challenges

We can get the base URL for images by calling the /configuration endpoint first. Create a new request to fetch those URLs. You can use somthing similar to the following struct.

```Swift
struct MovieDBConfiguration  {
    struct Images {
        let baseUrl: URL
        let secureBaseUrl: URL
        let backdropSizes: [String]
        let logoSizes: [String]
        let posterSizes: [String]
        let profileSizes: [String]
        let stillSizes: [String]
    }

    let images: Images
    static var current: MovieDBConfiguration?
}
```
