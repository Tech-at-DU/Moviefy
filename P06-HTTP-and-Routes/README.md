# HTTP Methods and Routes 

> Go back to `Request.swift` and add the following enums before the existing struct:

```Swift
public enum HTTPMethod: String{  
    case get = "GET"
    case post = "POST"
    case put = "PUT"
    case patch = "PATCH"
    case delete = "DELETE"
}
```

This enum represents all the available HTTP methods you will be able to use.

```Swift
public enum Route: String{
    case movies = "discover/movie"
}
```

This enum represents all the available endpoints you will be able to use.

# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Create HTTP methods and routes'
$ git push
```
